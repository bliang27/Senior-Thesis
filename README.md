# Senior-Thesis
Collection of Jupyter notebooks used for analyzing player performance in soccer

## Preprocessing
To start, run the two notebooks located in the preprocessing folder. This will download data from the StatsBomb Open Data
repository and convert it to SPADL. This code is courtesy of Decroos et al. and can be originally downloaded at 
https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction.

NOTE: The second preprocessing notebook is currently broken. A fix is being worked on.

## Network Analysis
All notebooks used for analysis in my senior thesis are located in the Network Analysis folder. Each notebook can be
individually run.
